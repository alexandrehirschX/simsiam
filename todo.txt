important:
- why is memory leaking? 
- figure out collate function
- try more augmentations
- apply individual instance mask or all?


speed:
- DONE       try detectron2 rasterize method for mask
- KINDA DONE check speeds of image loading methods (optimize)
- load all images as torch tensors instead of np arrays?
- retry using Image library and attempt 4th channel
- try mask finding methods (optimize)
- load images as uint8 or float32/64?
